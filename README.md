# Professor Messer SY0-701 Security+ Progress Tracker

This is a simple, interactive web application designed to help track progress through Professor Messer's CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 video course. Users can mark videos as complete, and the application dynamically updates a progress bar and percentage, with data saved locally in the browser (using localStorage).

## Features

* **Comprehensive List:** Includes all videos from Professor Messer's SY0-701 course with titles, run times, and descriptions.
* **Interactive Checkboxes:** Mark videos as completed with a single click.
* **Dynamic Progress Bar:** Visual representation of overall course completion.
* **Percentage & Count Display:** Shows exact number of completed videos and overall percentage.
* **Persistent Data:** Progress is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists across sessions.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Structure of the web page.
* **CSS:** Styling for a clean and user-friendly interface.
* **JavaScript:** Handles the interactive elements, progress calculation, and local storage management.

## How I Built This (and Why it Matters)

This project was developed to provide a practical tool for my own Security+ study journey. It allowed me to apply foundational web development concepts in a tangible way.

I utilized **AI-assisted development** tools to accelerate the initial scaffolding and repetitive coding tasks. My process involved:
1.  **Defining clear requirements** for the application's functionality (e.g., video list, checkboxes, progress bar, saving state).
2.  **Prompting the AI** to generate the basic HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic for handling checkbox changes and local storage.
3.  **Reviewing and understanding** the generated code to ensure it met my requirements and security best practices (e.g., efficient DOM manipulation, proper local storage usage).
4.  **Customizing and refining** the code (e.g., adding specific Professor Messer video details, improving styling, ensuring robust progress calculation).
5.  **Debugging** any issues and ensuring the application was fully functional.

This approach not only allowed me to rapidly prototype a useful tool but also deepened my understanding of web technologies and the effective application of AI in a development workflow. It demonstrates my ability to articulate technical requirements, review code, and integrate different components to create a functional solution.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository: `git clone [Your GitHub Repo URL]`
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  Click the checkboxes next to the videos as you complete them. Your progress will automatically save!
